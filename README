Guide on how to use the algorithm:

All algorithmic trading is done in Historical Vol main code
You may need to import "ccxt" and other imports, but this may naturally work on VS code, I'm not sure.
I believe it will work best by cloning the repository on Github desktop and pulling it, opening onto VS code and running on there.

DATA SOURCE:

"historical data attempt" is the file i ran to originally download my data set from deribit.
it was then editted by "formatting dataset" which turned it into the datasets found in the folder.

HOW TO USE ALGORITHM:

1. Simply running the algorithm will start it to run through all data sets and give monthly profit/losses before showing diagrams at the end
2. To turn delta neutral trading on or off, change line 935 to True or False
3. To choose between historical volatility trading and implied volatility trading, use line 934, choosing "Implied" or "Historical"
4. To change the month of which the graph is shown at the end of running, change line 963 and 964 to your preference.
5. If running all 5 years of data is taking too long, edit the list in line 676 to reduce number of years
